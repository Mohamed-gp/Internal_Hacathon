            The IoT Agriculture System is a transformative solution that
            leverages the power of the Internet of Things in farming. By
            connecting sensors, devices, and equipment, this system creates a
            network that provides farmers with real-time data on various aspects
            of their fields. From soil moisture and temperature to crop health
            and irrigation, the IoT Agriculture System offers a comprehensive
            view of the farm's operations. This connectivity enables smarter
            decision-making, efficient resource utilization, and ultimately,
            higher yields. Embracing this technology means embracing a new era
            of precision and productivity in agriculture.

            <p>
              Our system is a combination betwen Ai and iot. all of this we have
              imployed in agriculture.<br />
              and this how that fonction :

            <span
              >After you've acquired our humble service and activated the
              system,</span
            >
            the first step is to partition your agricultural land into various
            sections according to your preferences. Once the land is divided,
            you specify the type of plant you wish to cultivate in each section,
            along with the planting date. This is aimed at providing accurate
            information and ensuring the optimal application of our service.
            Once you've completed these steps, the dedicated robot embarks on
            its initial patrol. It roams around the cultivated areas, collecting
            data for each section individually. This information is then
            transmitted to the system for assessment, distinguishing between
            healthy and affected portions. In the event of any damage, the
            system identifies the cause and presents it to the user, along with
            proposed solutions. Upon approval, the system addresses the issue
            according to its nature. For instance, if it detects elevated toxin
            levels hindering plant growth, it suggests the necessary pesticide.
            Once confirmed, the user loads the drone with the prescribed
            pesticide, and the robot, as mentioned earlier, takes care of
            applying it to the designated area.

          In the case of land integrity, we proceed to the next stage. The
          sensor supplies our system with the necessary climatic information
          required to validate weather forecasts. This enables the system to
          generate accurate calculations essential for safeguarding agricultural
          soil and achieving successful growth without causing any harm. Let's
          consider two scenarios as examples:
          <ol>
            <li>
              High Temperature Condition: Elevated temperatures can lead to soil
              dryness and rapid water evaporation during irrigation. In
              response, the system determines the need for dual daily watering
              sessionsâ€”dawn and duskâ€”to saturate the soil and prevent water loss
              through evaporation.
            </li>
            <li style="margin-top: 10px">
              Low Temperature Condition: This climate tends to be somewhat humid
              or might bring occasional rain. In such cases, the system performs
              calculations and decides that a single watering session is
              sufficient, without specifying a particular time. It's important
              to note that plant type is also a factor in these calculations, as
              not all plants have the same water consumption rates.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="pic">
          <img src="IMG/Rectangle 77.png" alt="" />
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="lastSec">
        <div class="pgh1">
          On the other hand, when it comes to irrigation, as mentioned earlier,
          not all plant types require the same amount of water. Recognizing
          this, our system takes into account the user-designated land divisions
          and the chosen vegetable types for cultivation. It then strategically
          directs water as needed through an advanced directional control
          mechanism, which you can find detailed on the machinery page. After
          one area has been watered and another needs attention, the system
          automatically and intelligently rotates the device. This ensures the
          efficient management of irrigation without the farmer needing to
          manually adjust the water flow direction. This way, when the
          irrigation schedule for one section is complete, the system seamlessly
          transitions to the next, optimizing water distribution and reducing
          the need for manual intervention.
